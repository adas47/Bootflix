### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had a lot of issues getting the movie images to actually show up. When I talked with the Tech Gurus, they informed me that the Api key is not working. It is apparently not updated within the course page offered to me at the moment, and it will hopefully be updated soon.
The code is working properly, which is demonstrated when I have put a random image using its link in there. The Tech Guru told me to leave it with the random image of the spiderman movie poster.
